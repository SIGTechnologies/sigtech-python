# Contributing to SigTech Python SDK: A Guide

Welcome to our SDK! We highly value and encourage user contributions and are striving to make the contribution process as easy, transparent, and efficient as possible. Whether you're reporting a problem, proposing code changes, suggesting new features, or adding a new example strategy, your contributions are greatly appreciated.

Before you begin, please familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All users, including both external contributors and SigTech employees, are expected to adhere to these guidelines when interacting with others and this repository.

### Using Github

We utilize Github as our platform for hosting code, tracking issues and feature requests, and accepting pull requests. To participate, you will need to have a Github account.

### Licensing

Please note that when you submit code changes, your contributions are automatically assumed to be under the same [MIT license](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. If you have any concerns regarding licensing, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XcVJDYV4k7).

### Code Style and Linting

Before submitting your contributions, please ensure that your code adheres to the prescribed code style and linting standards. Run the following tools:

- [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting.

## Reporting a Problem

If you encounter any issues while using our SDK, we rely on GitHub issues to track and resolve them. Before reporting a problem, please search our [open issues](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/issues/) to check if a similar issue already exists. If you don't find a related problem, you can easily report it by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/issues/new).

To ensure effective issue reporting, please include the following details:

- A concise summary and any relevant background information.
- Clear and specific steps to reproduce the problem.
  - If possible, provide sample code.
- Your expected outcome.
- The actual behavior observed.
- Any additional notes, such as your assumptions or failed attempts to resolve the problem.

Providing a comprehensive issue report enables us to address the problem promptly.

## Proposing Code Changes

To propose changes to the codebase, we recommend submitting pull requests. We follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) methodology and welcome your pull requests. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch based on `master`.
2. If your changes introduce new code that requires testing, include the necessary tests.
3. If you modify any APIs, ensure that you update the documentation accordingly.
4. Validate that the test suite passes successfully.
5. Make sure your code complies with the defined code style and linting standards.
6. Submit your pull request, and we'll handle the rest!

## Submitting an Example Strategy

We're excited to see the innovative strategies our users can develop using our SDK. If you have an exciting strategy you'd like to share, consider submitting it as an example to be added to our [examples](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/tree/master/examples) directory.

To submit an example, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch based on `master`.
2. Add your example strategy as a `.py` or `.ipynb` file in the `examples` folder. Ensure the file is named `Draft_<Strategy_Name>`. Your example should include:
    - A brief summary of the strategy at the beginning.
    - Clearly commented Python code.
    - A visualization showcasing the strategy's performance.

## Proposing a New Feature

If you have ideas for new features, we encourage you to discuss them in our Discord channel. To stay informed about upcoming features and endpoints, please refer to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZcFeutSrWM) platform.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to seeing the positive impact you make on the SigTech Python SDK!
