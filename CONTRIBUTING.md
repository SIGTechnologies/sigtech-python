# Contributing to SigTech Python SDK
We appreciate and encourage user contributions to our SDK! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a problem (e.g. a bug)
- Proposing a change to the code 
- Proposing a new feature
- Adding a new example strategy

>**Reminder!**\
>All users are expected to abide by the [Code of conduct](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when interacting with other users, SigTech employees and this repository.

### Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. You will need a Github account to report
### Licensing
Please be aware that when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [License](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact us over [Discord](https://discord.gg/XcVJDYV4k7) if that's a concern.

### Code style and linting
Run black, flake8.

## Reporting a problem
We use GitHub issues to track problems. Before reporting a problem, search our [open issues](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/issues/)to see if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue Report a problem by [raising a new issue](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/issues/new), it's that easy!

### How to write a good issue
Please include:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Include sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

The more thorough your issue report, the quicker we can fix it!

## Proposing a change to the code 
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Submitting an example
We are very excited to see what our users can accomplish with our API. If you come up with a strategy you are excited to share, please consider submitting it to be added as one of our [examples](https://github.com/SIGTechnologies/sigtech-python/tree/master/examples).

### How to submit an example
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
1. Add your example strategy to the `examples` folder as a `.py` or `.ipynb` file with the title `Draft_<Strategy_Name>`. Your example should:
    1. Contain a short summary of the strategy you created at the top.
    1. Have commented python code
    1. Have a visualization of the strategy's performance 

## Proposing a new feature
Discuss any new features you would like to see in our Discord channel. To see upcoming new features and endpoints, please refer to [Discord](https://discord.gg/XcVJDYV4k7).
