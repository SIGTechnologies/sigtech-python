    "## Introduction to Nasdaq momentum strategies\n",
    "This strategy aims to capitalize on momentum trends in the Nasdaq (`NQ`) index futures contract. The strategy employs a combination of traditional technical indicators and machine learning to identify potential entry and exit points for trades based on momentum signals in the historical price data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our strategy\n",
    "- We will create a dataframe of technical indicators monitoring the performance of Nasdaq futures.\n",
    "- The dataframe will be used to train an XGBoost model and obtain predictions about which dates to take a long or short position on NQ futures.\n",
    "- We will backtest the performance of a signals strategy which trades based on these predictions and compare its performance to a benchmark rolling futures strategy,\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Create a dataframe of multiple technical indicators on the performance of Nasdaq futures\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical indicators being used are:\n",
    "- 4-week and 12-week simple moving averages (to identify trends in the Nasdaq index price data). Crossovers between shorter and longer MAs can signal potential shifts in momentum and help determine entry and exit points for trades.\n",
    "- 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) which measures the speed and change of price movements and determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold.\n",
    "- Bollinger Bands consisting of a 20-week moving average and upper and lower bands representing standard deviations from the MA. These bands help identify periods of high or low volatility, which can indicate potential price breakouts or reversals.\n",
    "- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) calculated by finding the difference between two exponential moving averages (`exp12` and `exp26`) of the closing prices of Nasdaq index futures. This helps identify short-term and long-term trends in the Nasdaq index futures.\n",
    "- Volatility, measured by the standard deviation of closing prices over a rolling window of 20 periods."
