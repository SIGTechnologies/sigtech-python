    "## Introduction to a seasonal grain basket strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy leverages the seasonal patterns in the Corn, Soybean, and Wheat futures markets to make trading decisions. The strategy takes advantage of the differences in supply and pricing between the old crop and new crop months. The key components of this strategy are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seasonal patterns**: the strategy is based on the understanding that the standardized trading months for Corn, Soybean, and Wheat futures align with the seasonal patterns in planting, harvesting, and marketing the underlying crops. For example, spring is the planting season for Corn and Soybeans, while fall is the planting season for Wheat. Similarly, July is the typical harvest month for Wheat, while November and December are the harvest months for Corn and Soybeans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Old crop vs. new crop**: during the planting months, the source of grain available is from crops harvested during the previous harvest season, known as the \"old crop.\" On the other hand, during the harvest months, the newly harvested crop comes to the market, resulting in higher supply, known as the \"new crop.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seasonal pricing**: When a new crop is harvested and supply is higher, the grain markets tend to reflect their lowest seasonal prices. Conversely, during the old crop months when supply is typically lower, grain prices tend to be higher compared to the farther out new-crop trading months.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usefulness of the prophet library\n",
    "\n",
    "The prophet library is key to this strategy because it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robust to missing data: prophet is capable of handling missing data points in the time series.\n",
    "- Handles shifts in the trend: it can identify and adapt to shifts in the underlying trend of the time series.\n",
    "- Outlier handling: prophet typically performs well even when the data contains outlier values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to capitalize on seasonal patterns in Corn, Soybean, and Wheat futures by using the prophet forecasting model to generate price forecasts and employs mean reversion strategies based on the forecasts. First we will model the performance of single grain and see if our strategy outperforms the market. If it does, we will combines signals from all three grain contracts to build a diversified grain basket. It has shown superior performance through backtesting and outperforming the market.\n",
