    "## Introduction to pairs trading\n",
    "A pairs trading strategy is a market-neutral trading strategy that simultaneously trades two correlated financial instruments in order to profit from temporary price divergences between them. The strategy is based on the concept of cointegration, which suggests that certain assets move together in the long run, even though they may experience short-term price deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how backtesting a pairs trading strategy typically works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying pairs** - we try to find assets that have historically exhibited a strong correlation. These assets can be from the same sector or industry, have similar business models, or belong to related markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculating the Spread** - after identifying some assets which could potentially exhibit cointegration, we calculate the spread between the two asset prices. The spread is typically a simple arithmetic difference or a normalized z-score between the prices of the two assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generating signals** - for assets which do exhibit cointegration, we define some signals, based on statistical measures, to determine when to initiate trades. These signals signify a trading direction depending on if the spread widens or narrows relative to its historical mean or equilibrium level.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backtesting** - finally, we backtest the performance of a strategy which trades when the spread widens significantly beyond some predetermined thresholds. If the spread becomes too wide, we short the relatively expensive asset and simultaneously go long on the relatively cheap asset. Conversely, when the spread narrows and comes back within the threshold, we close the positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Our strategy\n",
    "1. **Identifying pairs** - we will investigate if there is cointegration between the prices of feeder cattle, live cattle, corn and rough rice.\n",
    "1. **Calculating the spread** - we will calculate the spread using cointegration steps from the `statsmodel` library.\n",
    "1. **Generating signals** - we will calculate the spread using the z_score_limit and window size for the price relationship between paired assets.\n",
    "1. **Backtesting** - we will use the `sig.SignalStrategy` method, to backtest the performance of a pairs trading strategy based on the cointegrated assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Identifying pairs\n",
    "The assets being considered in this strategy are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feeder Cattle (FC)**: Feeder cattle are weaned calves that are sent to feedlots to be fattened for slaughter. Their prices can be influenced by factors such as feed prices, weather, and beef demand.\n",
    "- **Live Cattle (LC)**: Live cattle are cattle that are ready for slaughter. Similar to feeder cattle, their prices can be affected by feed prices, weather, and beef demand, as well as export markets.\n",
    "- **Corn (C)**: Corn is a staple crop used in food production and as a feedstock in the production of ethanol. Its prices can be influenced by weather, crop yields, and demand from the ethanol industry.\n",
    "- **Rough Rice (RR)**: Rough rice is rice that has just been harvested and has not yet been milled. Its prices can be influenced by weather, crop yields, and demand from both domestic and international rice markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis before backtesting this strategy is that there will be some cointegration between the price of feeder cattle and live cattle and also between the price of corn and rough rice. We are also considering the possibility that we may find unexpected cointegration between the prices of one of the cattle assets and one of the grain assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Calculating the spread\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Create Rolling Futures for each asset\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize futures strategies for each of the commodity assets we are interested in, we will use our SDKs `RollingFutureStrategy` class to set up our futures contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "A full explanation for each parameter in the `sig.RollingFuturesStrategy` can be seen by running the following code cell to view the class's docstring. In short:\n",
    "- The `rolling_rule` parameter is set to `f_0`, meaning we are using the adjusted front month contract.\n",
    "- The `monthly_roll_days` parameter is set to `5:9`, meaning futures contracts will be rolled between the 5th and 9th business days of the month."

    "### 2.2 Define a function which will test pairs of commodities for cointegration\n",
    "\n",
    "After initializing our futures strategies, the next step in our pairs trading strategy is to test for cointegration between the various pairs of commodities. Cointegration is a statistical property of two or more time series variables which indicates if a linear combination of them is stationary. In the context of pairs trading, if two assets are cointegrated, it means they move together in such a way that the spread between them is mean-reverting. This property is fundamental to the success of a pairs trading strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test for cointegration, we first retrieve the historical data for each asset and then reindex them to ensure they are of the same size. We then use the `coint` function from the `statsmodels` library to run a cointegration test. This function returns a score, p-value, and critical values. We primarily focus on the p-value, which tells us the probability that we would see the observed data if the two series were not cointegrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a function `test_cointegration(asset1, asset2)`, which takes two assets as inputs, performs the cointegration test, and prints the p-value. If the p-value is less than 0.05 (a common threshold in statistical testing), we conclude that the assets are cointegrated and we can proceed with a pairs trading strategy. If the p-value is above 0.05, we conclude that the assets are not cointegrated, and we should not proceed with pairs trading.\n",
