    "## Introduction to an FX futures momentum strategy\n",
    "An FX futures momentum strategy is a trading strategy that aims to capitalize on the persistence of trends in currency futures prices. The basic idea behind the strategy is to go long (buy) on currency futures that have exhibited strong positive returns over a certain period and go short (sell) on those with weak returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our strategy\n",
    "- We will define a dictionary of FX assets and create a `RollingFutureStrategy` for each asset.\n",
    "- For each asset's rolling futures strategy, we will calculate historical percentage changes (returns) over time and use these to generate signals for the strategy. After generating the signals, we will rank the strategies in descending order using the rank method. The top 20% will be longed and the bottom 20% will be shorted.\n",
    "- Finally, the ranked signals for each contract will be combined into a signal DataFrame and input into the `SignalStrategy` class to create the trend following strategy.\n",

    "## 1. Create the assets\n",
