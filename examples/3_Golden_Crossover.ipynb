    "\n",
    "The three main components of the Golden Crossover strategy are:\n",
    "- **Simple moving averages (SMAs)**: moving averages are calculated by taking the average price of an asset over a specified period. In the case of the golden crossover strategy, two specific SMAs are used: the short-term moving average and the long-term moving average.\n",
    "- **Golden crossover**: the golden crossover occurs when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average. It is considered a bullish signal.\n",
    "- **Death cross**: occurs when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average. It is considered a bearish signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our strategy\n",
    "- Will generate and test a golden cross strategy for trading the E-mini S&P 500 (ES) futures contract. \n",
    "- The strategy will use two simple moving averages (SMAs) with different time periods (60 days and 1 year) to generate buy and sell signals based on golden crossover and death cross events.\n",
